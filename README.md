The **Ant Lion Optimizer** is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the predatory behavior of antlions and the cooperative behavior of ants. The algorithm aims to discover optimal solutions by emulating the natural interactions between antlions and ants within their ecosystem. Antlions construct traps to capture ants, and the algorithm simulates this process to converge towards the global optimum of a given problem. For this problem, we have used 23 Benchmarking Functions to test different functions. Proper parameter tuning and problem-specific objective functions play a crucial role in ALO's effectiveness across various optimization tasks.
